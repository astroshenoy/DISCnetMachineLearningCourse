# Failures of Machine Learning

## Early failures in machine learning
Here’s Minsky talking some of the early failures of Perceptrons (the first real Neural Nets); these can still be problems today and mean you really must think about what your machine is learning:

### The first DARPA grand challenge (2004)

> "The first competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge was held on March 13, 2004 in the Mojave Desert region of the United States, along a 150-mile (240 km) route that follows along the path of Interstate 15 from just before Barstow, California to just past the California–Nevada border in Primm. None of the robot vehicles finished the route. Carnegie Mellon University's Red Team and car Sandstorm (a converted Humvee) traveled the farthest distance, completing 11.78 km (7.32 mi) of the course before getting hung up on a rock after making a switchback turn. No winner was declared, and the cash prize was not given. Therefore, a second DARPA Grand Challenge event was scheduled for 2005."

### Robotics failures

Teaching robots to do even simple things still has its challenges:
